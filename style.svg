          <p>I'm a web developer focusing mainly on front-end development. I have used Javascript and libs such as ReactJS, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, NodeJS, MongoDB, MySQL, Express, and Axios. I am willing to learn new technologies as well and I have been studying SASS, Typescript, Shopify, and Liquid.</p>
          <p>I am also a clinical nutritionist, post-graduated in Nutritional Therapy and Clinical Nutrition. From 2014 to 2022, I worked at a hospital providing nutritional assistance to sick individuals, focused on promoting, maintaining, and recovering health, but I wanted more.</p>
          <p>I have always been interested in technology and in 2021 I started studying programming on my own. In 2022, I decided to change careers and did two bootcamps, one of Web Development at Ironhack and the other of Full Stack JS Developer at Technology Experts. In 2023, I started my journey in the Internet Systems course at UniCesumar. I'm currently an intern as a web developer at Vasta. Now, I want to make people's lives more pleasant through my code.</p>
